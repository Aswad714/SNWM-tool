  <h2 align="center">Social Network Web Mining (SNWM) Tool</h2>
 

## Introduction
The source code of the SNWM tool is planned to be released in stages. Stages are designed based on the human resource available for the project. The first stage is the proof of concept stage, the second stage is the minimum viable product stage, the third stage is the first stable release and finally proceeding stable releases will be published. Currently, the tool is in proof of concept stage, whereas, features of each stage are explained as follows:

###### Proof of concept
The first stage of the source code includes functions and classes to perform mining from the social network website. It is able to download posts, attributes, comments, and likes from the social network website, however, they are stored as CSV files, which are then imported into MySQL database independently.

###### Minimum viable product 
The second stage includes full integration of the MySQL database into the java application, hence, the collected information is directly stored in the database.

###### First stable release 
The third stage overhauls complete code in order to maximize its reproducibility. As open source technologies are used, the complete set of code is platform independent. Therefore, this stage also documents the code distribution for Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.


###### Proceeding stable releases
The fourth stage is the transition of this project from a single developer and distributor to a community developing and releasing the software, god willing. Also, this stage will include the docker container of the developed code.
